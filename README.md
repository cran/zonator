# zonator

`zonator` is a utility R package for dealing with various tasks related to
Zonation conservation prioritization software. The package started out as a collection
of helper scripts which have now been packages for anybody interested in using
a familiar tool (R) in setting up Zonation runs and managing Zonation results.

Functions and classes found in `zonator` can be useful for following stages
of running a Zonation analysis.

1. Setting up a Zonation project and pre-processing files ([examples](http://cbig.github.io/zonator/vignettes/zonator-project.html)).
1. Running Zonation.
1. Post-processing, results analysis and comparison, and plotting ([examples](http://cbig.github.io/zonator/vignettes/zonator-results.html)).

```
# Open R prompt or RStudio and type the following on the command line
